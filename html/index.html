                    <p><br>Dear Parents and Students, <br>
                        So why we are established here not only to send Nepalese students to Japan but also to make them
                        known about its essence. And we are playing and we have to play huge role to expand Japanese
                        language and culture in Nepal and make Japanese people to know about our language and culture
                        too. At the time of registration of this school around 2014 we were worried with the
                        establishment in this competitive time but we don't know how time passed by and we succeed to
                        exchange around 2000 students at Japan.
                        But we still think that we are not that much grown up to say that we are the only one because
                        rather than focusing to increase the number of students only we use to focus to give them
                        quality counseling and think from students side so why they can feel easy after they reach Japan
                        too. Because they can easily dilute them in the Japanese society with the education and training
                        that they get from KL Japanese Language School.
